# Map Master Quiz (IT)
Ciao a tutti, questo è il mio progetto su un gioco a quiz sulla geografia chiamato Map Master.
Verrà visualizzata una bandiera alla volta e il tuo obiettivo è quello di scegliere la risposta corretta tra le proposte!    
*VEDI QUÌ L'ANTEPRIMA!* [Map Master](https://stupendous-daifuku-c013bc.netlify.app/)
### Le tecnologie che ho usato sono:
* HTML
* CSS con l'ausilio di preprocessore SASS
* Javascript
* React (utilizzando la sua libreria React Router per creare la web app)
### Come avviare il progetto
Avvia il progetto come qualsiasi progetto React, quindi con l'ausilio del comando npm start!
### Come funziona
Si verrà reindirizzati alla web app. 
Cliccando sul tasto 'Inizia!' il gioco inizierà. Verrà mostrata una bandiera e bisognerà selezionare la risposta giusta!
Un contatore sotto la bandiera ci indicherà quante bandiere mancano alla conclusione del gioco.
Alla fine ci verrà detto quante bandiere abbiamo assegnato correttamente e un bottone 'Riparti' con la quale si può riiniziare il gioco.
