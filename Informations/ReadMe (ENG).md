# Map Master Quiz (ENG)
Hi there, that's a project about a quiz game about geography called Map Master.
A flag and four options will be provided to you, your goal is to choose the right one!
### The technologies that I used are:
* HTML
* CSS with SASS preprocessor
* Javascript
* React (with React Router)
### How to start the project
Start it as every React project so, with npm start!
### How it Works
You will be redirected to web app. 
If you click on 'Inizia!' the game will start. A flag and four options will be provided to you, your goal is to choose the right one!
A counter under the flag will indicate us how many flags lasts until the end of the game.
At the end we'll have a final score and a button 'Riparti' to reinitialize the game.
